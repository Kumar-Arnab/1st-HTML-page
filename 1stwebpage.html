		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<h2>A few facts about the world we live in</h2>
		<img src="earth.jpg" width="300">
		<p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life.</p>

			<h3>About the earth</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Average <a href="https://www.space.com/17081-how-far-is-earth-from-the-sun.html">distance from the sun</a>: 92,956,050 miles (149,598,262 km)</li>
				<li>Perihelion (closest approach to the sun): 91,402,640 miles (147,098,291 km)</li>
				<li>Aphelion (farthest distance from the sun): 94,509,460 miles (152,098,233 km)</li>
				<li>Length of solar day (single rotation on its axis): 23.934 hours</li>
				<li>Length of year (single revolution around the sun): 365.26 days</li>
				<li>Equatorial inclination to orbit: 23.4393 degrees</li>

			<h4>Top 3 facts about the earth</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Scientists think Earth was formed at roughly the same time as the sun and other planets some 4.6 billion years ago, when the solar system coalesced from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula.</li>
				<li>Earth's core is about 4,400 miles (7,100 km) wide, slightly larger than half the Earth's diameter and about the same size as Mars' diameter.</li>
				<li>Earth's magnetic field is generated by currents flowing in Earth's outer core. The magnetic poles are always on the move, with the magnetic North Pole accelerating its northward motion to 24 miles (40 km) annually since tracking began in the 1830s. It will likely exit North America and reach Siberia in a matter of decades.</li>
